# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **<u>Scope</u>**

The scope of this app is to create a Python and Django based e-commerce site for an imaginary miniature painting commissions service. It aims to provide all relevant and expected functionality 
commonly found in e-shops to visitors, as well as an easy to use toolset for the site owner, customised to the specific product's demands. The app supports payments via Stripe and uses an 
AWS S3 bucket for media and static file storage.

### **<u>Wireframes</u>**

As part of the design process, before starting my project I made initial wireframes using [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com). Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.

The final design has been influenced by my mentor and the need to redesign and simplify some features. In this senses the wireframes map the journey from idea to functioning app.

- [Mobile view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/mobile.pdf)
- [Tablet view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/tablet.pdf)


### **<u>Design</u>**

**Structure**

- A simple design structure with a fixed navbar, a dropdown side navigation menu accessible from every page and a fixed footer. A brand logo is displayed in the top left of the screen to allow easy navigation back to the homepage.

- As a mobile first site I contained the logo, login button and nav menu icon centered by two spaces creating a core towards the center of the page. This helps keep the design consistent as it moves from smaller to larger viewports.

- As well as including a title tag on my base.html, I have also added the meta description tag to help optimize my click-through rate from search engine result pages.

**Colour palette**

- The #333333 shade of grey has been used for the main background throughout the site with all the forms using a #fafafa shade of white creating a slight contrast.

- Default Bootstrap white (#fff) was used as a background for the navbar as well as the colour of various UI buttons throughout the site. 

- The #fafafa shade of white has been used as a background for cards and forms throughout the app.

- The ##7ab648 shade of green has been used as the accent colour for title text throughout the website, as well as the color of more prominent callouts and buttons.

- I decided on this high contrast colour scheme as the colours work well with the subject matter of the website. 

<img src="static/assets/images/readme/palette.png">

**Typography**

- The main font used throughout the site is 'Lato' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

- I have used the 'Julius Sans One' font to create the 'uReview' logo as it pairs well with my overall branding. Moreover it has been used as the font for titles and fonts all over the site.


**Logo Design**

- I created my own logo design using typography and css to make it high-res and responsive. The color #333333 is used as it is a shade of grey commonly used in miniatures and green represents both ready and painted as the only touch of color.

- Following website conventions, my website logo is a link to the homepage. Over time many people have learned that clicking on a site’s logo leads them back to the homepage so adopting this standard reduces confusion by matching the UI to users’ expectations. The logo is also left-aligned which is the most familiar placement, and is where users look to find it.


### <u>**User stories**</u>

**Visitor UX:**

* As a visitor I want to easily navigate the site and find reviews from the home page.

* As a visitor I want to sort and search posted reviews based on a categories or keywords. 

* As a visitor I want to find where I can create an account easily. 


**Registered User UX**

* As a registered user I want to easily find how I can log-in in order to post a review. 

* As a registered user I want to be able to add my review easily. 

* As a registered user I want to see a collection of my posted reviews in one page.

* As a registered user I want to have a profile page that bundles functionality.

* As a registered user I want to be able to edit and delete my reviews. 

* As a registered user I want to see new content first on consequtive site visits. 

 
**Administrator User UX**

* As an administrator I want to easily moderate user posted contents.

* As an administrator I want to be able to manage genres and platforms by adding new ones or deleting underused ones.


 > **Note**: The user stories are tested in [testing.md](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/uReview/blob/master/testing.md).

## &rarr; **Database Architecture**

## &rarr; **Deployment**

#### Deploy to Heroku

The project was connected to Heroku using automatic deployment from my GitPod repository, using the following steps...

> **Note:** Before following the below steps ensure you have already created your new repo in Github and set up an env.py file to store your sensitive data. (Further details on adding an env.py file below)

1. In the terminal create requirements.txt and Procfile files using the commands below:
   - $ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

   - $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile

   > **Note:** 
The **P**rocfile must be assigned a capital P.

2. Log in (or Register) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and from your dashboard click 'new' > 'create new app'.

3. Enter your 'App name' and choose the appropriate region, then click 'Create app'.
   > **Note:** 
 The app name must be unique, all lowercase, and '-' to be used instead of spaces.
The region chosen should be the one closest to you.

4. From the Heroku deploy tab, select the Deployment method 'GitHub'.

5. On the 'Connect to GitHub' section make sure your GitHub profile is displayed then add your repository name and click 'Search'.

   > **Note:** 
This is the name of your repo in GitHub. It is good practice to use an identical name for your Heroku app.

6. Your repo should now be displayed below, click 'Connect' to connect to this app.

7. Go to the Settings tab on Heroku, scroll to the 'Config Vars' section, and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. 

   Enter variables (key and value) contained in the env.py file. The keys are listed below and values are inputted by the user.
    - IP
    - PORT
    - SECRET_KEY
    - MONGO_URI
    - MONGO_DBNAME

8. Push requirements.txt and Procfile to the repository.

9. Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and under the Automatic deployment section, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. Then under Manual deploy click 'Deploy Branch'.

   - Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and start building the app using the required packages.
   - Once built you will receive the message 'Your app was successfully deployed' and you can click 'View' to launch your new app.

        > **Note:** 
        In Manual deploy dropdown 'master' is selected'

#### Accessing code

Follow the steps below if you are wanting to propose changes to the project or to use the project as a starting point for your own idea.

- **Forking the GitHub Repository**

  Forking allows you to create a copy of the original repository and propose changes to the repository owner via a pull request.

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.

  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.

  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

- **Making a Local Clone**

When you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
   - uReview repository can be found [here](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/uReview)

2. Under the repository name, click the "download code" option.   

3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.   

4. Open Git Bash

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ureview.git
    ```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

      Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the uReview repository.

    > **Note:** The repository name and output numbers that you see on your computer, representing the total file size, etc, may differ from the example I have provided above.

8. Add an env.py file to your workspace to include your environment variables (more details below).

   > **Note:** Contact the site owner if you want more information on the environment variables that have been included.

**Creating env.py file** 

1. Add a env.py file to store environment variables:
   - Import os 
   - os.environ.setdefault("IP", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "To be added by user")

    > **Note:** I used [RandomKeygen.com](https://randomkeygen.com/) to get my secure SECRET_KEY password. A SECRET_KEY is required when using the flash and session functions of Flask.

 2. Create a file named .gitignore and include env.py to ensure this file is never pushed to GitHub.
    > **Note:** The env.py mustn't be tracked as any GitHub user can access your confidential data.
